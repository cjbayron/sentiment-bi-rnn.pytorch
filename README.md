# Bi-directional LSTM for Sentiment Prediction

Bi-directional LSTM implementation of SentimentRNN from PyTorch Scholarship Challenge,
ported from [Sentiment RNN Exercise notebook](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch/blob/master/sentiment-rnn/Sentiment_RNN_Exercise.ipynb).

## Execution

In [sentiment_bi_rnn.py](sentiment_bi_rnn.py), set HOME to correct data location, then run:
```
python sentiment_bi_rnn.py
```
